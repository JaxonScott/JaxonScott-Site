            Hey, I'm Jaxon. I'm a full-stack developer based out of Ontario,
            Canada. My passion has always been with all things technology, which
            naturally led me into the world of software and writing code. I
            enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems for myself
            and others, as well as helping businesses by building their dream
            sites and software. On top of my passion for code, I also love cars.
            Which got me into automotive{" "}
            <span className="text-amber-300">photography</span>. I thoroughly
            enjoy being able to capture the cars that we all dream of one day
            owning. You can see some of my projects and photo work here:{" "}
